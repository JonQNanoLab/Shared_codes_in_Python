"Shared codes in Python" is a repository created by A. Nodar and J. Lasa whose
aim is to share some of the scientific codes generated during the development of
our PhD thesis.

We encourage any other PhD student programming in an open source language to do
the same, and create a repository with the codes that they might find useful.
